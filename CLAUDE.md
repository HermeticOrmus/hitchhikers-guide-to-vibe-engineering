# The Hitch-Hiker's Guide to Vibe Engineering

## Project Overview

A humorous yet practical guide to AI-assisted development, styled after Douglas Adams' "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy."

## Voice & Tone

- Witty, dry British humor
- Self-aware about AI limitations
- Practical advice wrapped in absurdist framing
- Never preachy, always entertaining
- References to the original H2G2 where appropriate

## Structure

```
chapters/     # Long-form guide chapters (numbered 00-09)
entries/      # Short "field guide" style entries
assets/       # Images, diagrams
```

## Key Themes

1. **The Great Debate** - Is this real engineering? Both sides examined
2. **DON'T PANIC** - Stay calm when AI fails
3. **Towel Principle** - Always have version control
4. **42** - Sometimes there's no perfect answer
5. **Mostly Harmless** - Risk assessment for techniques
6. **Babel Fish Problem** - Communication barriers with AI

## Writing Guidelines

- Each entry should stand alone
- Include practical code examples where relevant
- Rate danger level: Mostly Harmless → Caution Advised → Danger → Here Be Dragons
- End chapters with "Next:" link
- Use blockquotes for H2G2 references
- "Engineering" vs "Coding": We use "engineering" deliberately to emphasize understanding and ownership

## Target Audience

Developers curious about or actively using AI coding assistants who appreciate humor and want practical guidance without hype. Includes both vibe engineering advocates and skeptics.
