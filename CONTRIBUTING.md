## Welcome, Fellow Traveler

You've found this Guide floating through the vast emptiness of the internet. Perhaps you were looking for it. Perhaps you stumbled upon it while searching for something else entirely. Either way, you're here now, and that makes you one of us.

**This Guide belongs to everyone who uses it.**

## The Spirit of 42

The answer to life, the universe, and everything is 42. But what does that mean for contributing?

It means: **make things from the heart.**

Don't contribute because you want credit. Don't contribute because you think you should. Contribute because you have something to share that might help another traveler navigate the strange new world of AI-assisted development.

## What We're Looking For

### New Entries
Short, standalone pieces on specific topics. The Field Guide format:
- A witty H2G2-style intro quote
- Practical information
- Risk level rating
- Examples where helpful

### Chapter Improvements
Found something unclear? Something wrong? Something that could be funnier while remaining accurate? Open an issue or PR.

### Translations
The original Guide was available in every language in the galaxy (thanks to the Babel Fish). Ours should be too.

### Real-World Stories
Have you survived a vibe engineering disaster? Shipped something improbable? Your story might help others.

## Voice Guidelines

- **Witty, dry British humor** - Think Douglas Adams, not stand-up comedy
- **Self-aware about AI limitations** - We're not selling anything
- **Practical wrapped in absurdist** - Real advice, entertaining delivery
- **Never preachy** - We're guides, not gurus
- **Inclusive** - Both vibe enthusiasts and skeptics are welcome here

---

## The Only Rule

**DON'T PANIC.**

And don't be a jerk. The universe is large enough for all of us.

---

## Recognition

All contributors will be credited in the Guide. Not because we have to, but because that's what travelers do—we remember who helped us along the way.
