# The Hitch-Hiker's Guide to Vibe Coding

> **DON'T PANIC**

*In many of the more relaxed civilizations on the Outer Eastern Rim of the Galaxy, the Hitch-Hiker's Guide to Vibe Coding has already supplanted the great Encyclopedia Galactica as the standard repository of all knowledge and wisdom, for though it has many omissions and contains much that is apocryphal, or at least wildly inaccurate, it scores over the older, more pedestrian work in two important respects.*

*First, it is slightly cheaper; and secondly it has the words* **DON'T PANIC** *inscribed in large friendly letters on its cover.*

## What Is Vibe Coding?

**VIBE CODING** *(n.)*: The art of programming by describing what you want to an AI and letting it generate code, while you maintain creative direction and quality control. Named after the practice of "vibing" with the machine—a state of collaborative flow between human intent and artificial capability.

The Guide's entry on Vibe Coding begins:

> "Vibe Coding is the second-best way to write software in the known universe. The best way, of course, is to have someone else do it entirely while you sip Pan Galactic Gargle Blasters. Since most developers cannot afford infinite monkeys or infinitely patient colleagues, Vibe Coding represents a reasonable compromise."

## The Babel Fish Problem

The Babel Fish, by effectively removing all barriers to communication between different races and cultures, has caused more and bloodier wars than anything else in the history of creation.

Similarly, AI code generation—by effectively removing all barriers between "I have an idea" and "I have 10,000 lines of code"—has caused more technical debt than anything else in the history of software development.

The Guide offers this advice:

> "The key to successful Vibe Coding is knowing when NOT to code. Most problems don't need solutions. Most solutions don't need code. Most code doesn't need to exist."

## A Note on Accuracy

*The Guide has, in various editions, suggested that:*
- *AI models understand what they're doing (they don't)*
- *Generated code is always correct (it isn't)*
- *You can skip testing (please don't)*

*The editors apologize for any confusion, destruction of production databases, or existential crises that may have resulted.*

**Share and Enjoy!**

*"Share and Enjoy" is the company motto of the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation, whose complaints division now covers most of the known universe. This is also good advice for Vibe Coding—share your prompts, enjoy the process, and file bugs when things inevitably go wrong.*

*This Guide is dedicated to Douglas Adams, who taught us that the universe is not only queerer than we suppose, but queerer than we CAN suppose. The same is true of large language models.*
