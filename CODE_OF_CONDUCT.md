# Code of Conduct

> *"It is a mistake to think you can solve any major problems just with potatoes."*

> *It is also a mistake to think you can build a community without some basic guidelines.*

## The One Rule

**Don't be a Conditions of Relative Conditions of Relative Difficulty Inducer.**

Or in simpler terms: **Don't be a jerk.**

---

## The Slightly Longer Version

### Be Kind
The universe is vast, cold, and mostly empty. This community doesn't have to be. Treat others as you'd want to be treated after a long journey through hyperspace.

### Be Patient
Not everyone knows what you know. Some travelers are just starting their journey with AI-assisted development. Guide them; don't gatekeep.

### Be Constructive
Criticism is welcome. Cruelty is not. If you think something could be better, explain how. "This is wrong" helps no one. "This could be improved by..." helps everyone.

### Be Inclusive
All beings are welcome here—regardless of species, planet of origin, programming language preference, or opinions on tabs vs. spaces. (Though the Guide officially takes no position on that particular holy war.)

## What We Won't Tolerate

- Harassment of any kind
- Discrimination based on identity
- Trolling, insults, or personal attacks
- Publishing others' private information
- Being the kind of person who makes the universe slightly worse

---

## Enforcement

Violations may result in:
1. A polite reminder (we assume good intent first)
2. A warning
3. Temporary ban
4. Permanent ban (reserved for truly Conditions of Relative Conditions of Relative Difficulty)

---

## Reporting

If someone is making you uncomfortable, contact the maintainers. We take this seriously.

---

## In Summary

> *"A common mistake that people make when trying to design something completely foolproof is to underestimate the ingenuity of complete fools."*

We can't design a foolproof community. But we can agree to be kind to each other while we figure out this whole AI-assisted development thing together.

**DON'T PANIC. And don't be a jerk.**

*This Code of Conduct applies to all community spaces, including the repository, discussions, issues, and any associated communication channels.*
